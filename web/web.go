I think this will be just loading the index.html Templates
ex. homepage -> loads index.html -> index.html has alpine and htmx for hanling requests and so on
or we could do only one index.html and then depending on what buttons are clicked the htmx doese a
request to an api route and gets an html response and swaps inside index.html for the result he gets from
the api
